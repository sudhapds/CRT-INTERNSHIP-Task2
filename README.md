**TASK 2: IMAGE CLASSIFICATION FOR FOOD RECOGNITION**

**Description:**
•	Develop an image classification model to recognize different types of food items from images.

**Steps:**
1.	Data Collection: Collect a dataset of food images categorized into various classes.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and split data into training and testing sets.
3.	Model Architecture: Choose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet.
4.	Transfer Learning: Use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for your specific food classification task.
5.	Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
6.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy and other relevant metrics on the test dataset.
7.	Visualization: Visualize model predictions and explore misclassified images.

**Tech Stack:**
•	Python
•	Deep Learning frameworks 
•	Image processing libraries
